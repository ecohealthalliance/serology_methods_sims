For an initial model I think:
	-- One virus
	-- Species as a fixed effect for positivity
	-- Species as a fixed effect for MFI
	-- Location as a random effect for positivity
	-- Plate as a random effect for MFI

In stan speak:

   target += log_mix(beta_vec[n],
                     lognormal_lpdf(y[n] | mu[2, n], sigma[2]),
                     lognormal_lpdf(y[n] | mu[1, n], sigma[1]));

   beta_vec[n] = inv_logit(beta_base + location_dev[location[n]] + species[n, ] * beta_species);

   mu[1, n] = mu_base + plate_dev[plate[n]];
   mu[2, n] = mu[1, n] + species[n, ] * theta_species;
