1) On one hand, looking at for example, MenVN and  it would seem that Rousettus simply has ; however, looking at many others (e.g., HeVsG, CedVsG, EboVGP), the bulk of the Rousettus samples fall in line with the other two species. 
	-- So are these viruses in Rousettus common? 

2) Rousettus at Kanaipur, Faripur often have quite high MFI values (across many viruses, e.g., EboVGP, MenVN, MarVGP). 
	-- Unfortunately Kanaipur, Faripur, was only ever run on plate 5, and plate 5 has a higher median and much fatter right tail than any of the other plates (see comment 3 below). Thus, it may be impossible to separate plate from location, and thus it may be hard to assign positivity to this species in this location. On the other hand, some viruses, e.g., HeVsG, is still quite low for this location, which begs the question of whether these patterns are real or a run artifact.
	-- My feeling is something about this plate generated the odd, flat, almost uniform distributions seen for MERSN, SARSN, EboVGP, and that these patterns are less biological and more lab-process (in some way)

3) Plotting the plates against each other shows that there is actually relatively little plate variation, which is really good to see. Median of about 120 across plates (looking at all viruses). Only plate that stands out being plates 5 (see above comment), which was run with only Rousettus in Kanaipur, Faripur and has quite a fat right tail, but these may in fact be true positives. Another tick for randomization as much as possible.

4) To my eye, a few viruses stand out as having a few "clear" positives, HeVsG for sure and maybe CedVsG and  being  the best examples.
	-- Curious 

5) The most odd result might be MenVN, which has some really different patterns by species. 
	-- Is this an issue of assay differences gone awry? (e.g., wrong dilution for some?) 

5) With so many unimodal distributions, I do wonder what my clustering model will do with the data. Guess there is no other way than to try. 
	-- The important question though being how to define the model. Probably best to start with the most well behaved data, say either:
		-- the NiXXX viruses together without Kanaipur, Faripur as an example of unimodal distribution with a few outliers
		-- maybe SARSN without Kanaipur, Faripur, which has more of a second hump / strong[er] right tail in a few species / populations
